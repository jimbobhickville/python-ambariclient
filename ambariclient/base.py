    There are some nice convenience methods like create(), update(), and
    delete().  Unlike some ORMs, there's no way to modify values by updating
    attributes directly and then calling save() or something to send those to
    the server.  You must call update() with the keyword arguments of the fields
    you wish to update.  I've always found that allowing for attribute updates
    is problematic as some users expect that the update will happen immediately,
    when in reality they still have to call another method like save() to make
    those changes permanent. I might recant if enough people request the addition
    of attribute setters.

    All of the data in these objects is lazy-loaded.  It will only do the API
    request at a point where it needs to in order to proceed.  These cases are:

        * accessing an attribute that isn't already loaded
        * accessing a relationship
        * calling 'inflate()' directly
        * calling wait()

    If you hit a situation where you want to force an already-loaded object to
    get the latest data from the server, the refresh() method will do that for
    you.
